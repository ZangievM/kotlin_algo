### Extended Euclidean algorithm
In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor of integers a and b, also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ![alt-text](https://github.com/ZangievM/kotlin_algo/blob/master/src/euclideExtended/images/euclideExt.svg)
